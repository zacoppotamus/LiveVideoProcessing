Batch Image Pixel Sorting
===



###TO DO###
* Live input mode where sorting parameters are controlled through MIDI input
* Use shaders instead
* Make operations state-based rather than stateless
* Audio-Reactive (Max/MSP?)
* Alter Image should work the same irrespective of image dimensions
* Make this into a separate module that can be incorporated with the Force Attraction Pen.
